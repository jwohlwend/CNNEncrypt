# CNNEncrypt

CNNEncrypt was made as part of a final project for 6.867 - Machine Learning (MIT)
It contains an example implementation of the network design described in the recently published paper:

"Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography" (2016) by  Mart√≠n Abadi, David G. Andersen (Google Brain).

## Usage 

The required packages can be found in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using:  

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that using the GPU implementation of Tensorflow increases performance dramatically.
We recommend using a GPU for training since this particular 
experiment requires thousands of training iterations over large batches.

To run the training, modify the parameters at the top of the train.py script:   

* N - size of the keys and plaintext  
* batch_size - the number of training examples to use in a single iteration
* epochs - the number of training iterations

and run:  

`python train.py`
